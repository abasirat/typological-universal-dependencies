# Typological Universal Dependencies (TUD)

<a href=https://universaldependencies.org/>Universal Dependencies (UD)</a> is a global initiative to create a standard annotation for the dependency syntax of human languages. Addressing its deviation from typological principles, this study presents an empirical investigation of a typologically motivated transformation of UD. Our findings underscore the significance of the transformations across diverse languages and highlight their advantages and limitations.

This repositiry includes codes for coverting Universal Dependencies (UD) to Typological Universal Dependencies (TUD). A detailed report of the **Contribution of Linguistic Typology to Universal Dependencies** is presented at EMNLP 2024. 

The actual sctipt that perform the transformation is `ud2tud.py`.
